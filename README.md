### README: Creating in Photoshop

Welcome to this guide on creating an eye-catching travel poster of London using Adobe Photoshop. Follow these steps to create a stunning visual that captures the essence of this iconic city!

#### Requirements:
- Adobe Photoshop
- High-resolution images of London landmarks (e.g., Big Ben, Tower Bridge, London Eye)
- Fonts (download and install any additional fonts you plan to use)

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Your Document**
   - Open Adobe Photoshop and create a new document.
   - Set the dimensions to your desired poster size (e.g., 18x24 inches) with a resolution of 300 dpi for print quality.

2. **Background**
   - Choose a suitable background color or gradient that complements your theme. To do this, go to `Layer` > `New Fill Layer` > `Solid Color` or `Gradient`.
   - Alternatively, you can use an image of the London skyline as your background. Go to `File` > `Place Embedded` to add the image.

3. **Add Images of Landmarks**
   - Import high-resolution images of London landmarks. Use `File` > `Place Embedded` to add each image.
   - Use the `Move Tool (V)` to position the images.
   - Use `Ctrl+T` (Cmd+T on Mac) for Free Transform to scale and rotate the images as needed.
   - Apply a layer mask to blend the images seamlessly. Select the image layer, then click the `Add Layer Mask` button at the bottom of the Layers panel. Use a soft brush to mask out hard edges.

4. **Enhance the Images**
   - Adjust the brightness and contrast of each image by going to `Image` > `Adjustments` > `Brightness/Contrast`.
   - Apply filters to create a cohesive look. Try using `Filter` > `Camera Raw Filter` for adjustments.

5. **Add Text**
   - Select the `Text Tool (T)` and click on the canvas to add your text.
   - Choose a bold and readable font for the main title, such as "London".
   - Add a tagline or additional information (e.g., "Explore the Heart of England").
   - Customize the text with colors, effects, and transformations. Use the `Character` panel for detailed adjustments.

6. **Add Design Elements**
   - Add shapes, lines, or other design elements to enhance your poster. Use the `Shape Tool (U)` to add elements such as banners or dividers.
   - Use `Layer Styles` (double-click on the layer) to add effects like drop shadows, strokes, and glows.

7. **Final Adjustments**
   - Review your poster and make any final adjustments to colors, alignment, and spacing.
   - Use `Ctrl+L` (Cmd+L on Mac) to adjust Levels for a final touch.

8. **Save and Export**
   - Save your Photoshop file (.PSD) to retain all layers and adjustments.
   - Export the poster for print or web. Go to `File` > `Export` > `Export As` and choose the desired format (e.g., JPEG for print, PNG for web).

### Tips:
- Keep your design balanced and not too cluttered.
- Use high-quality images to ensure clarity in print.
- Experiment with different fonts and colors to find the best combination.
